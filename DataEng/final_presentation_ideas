Overall:

1: DataEng
    use slides from 1st lecture
    - ResearchQuestion and how to test it
    - Creation of out train/val/test dataset -> figure and tables from evaluation
    - Accuracy of Mediapipe Hands and value selection -> You should make a graph only on testing set....
    - Experiment:
        H0:
            Same model, different training data , same result?
        Method:
            compare training and validation step (100 and 10 timepoints)
        Results:
            compare accuracy on validation set 100 times  big:accuracy comapre + 2x small individual verlauf detailes
            compare accuracy on training testing set 10 times: big accuracy compare+ 3x small class compare
            on dif preprocess testing data accuracy: same as above 1x3
            finally a slide with short results overview
    - Conclusion: does it help? -> yes
